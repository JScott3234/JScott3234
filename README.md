- 👋 Hey! I’m Jase

- I've got experience in Unity Game Development, VR and soon to be 3D Rendering
- 👀 I’m interested in helping others with their projects while I learn how to make my own
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science. Aiming for a B.A Degree in CS.
- I really like using MVC Architecture for when I do a whole project, separating front and back-end makes components WAYY more modular
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything I can get my hands on.
- 📫 How to reach me: jasehudsonscott@icloud.com , or through my LinkedIn on my page.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Despite being a computer guy, I also enjoy being out in nature. Nothing is more relaxing than hiking and exploring with friends!
