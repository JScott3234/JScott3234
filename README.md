- 👋 Hey! I’m Jase
- 👀 I’m interested in helping others with their projects while I learn how to make my own
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science. Aiming for a B.A Degree in CS.
- I'm experienced in using Java, JavaScript, and HTML, but want to learn more, just not sure what to tackle next. Maybe Hexadecimal...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything I can get my hands on. I'm fresh, curious, and ready for work.
- 📫 How to reach me: jasehudsonscott@icloud.com , or through my LinkedIn on my page.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Despite being a computer guy, I also enjoy being out in nature. Nothing is more relaxing than hiking and exploring with friends!
